# Tic-Tac-Toe
I made a simple tic-tac-toe game in Python. Player 1 enters their name. They can choose to play against a second human player or an easy or hard AI player.
## How to Play
Download all files and place them in the same folder. Run tictac.py in any python compliler and follow the instructions.
